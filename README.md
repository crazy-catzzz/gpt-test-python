# gpt-test-python

A small OpenAI API test written in Python.

Can't test it anymore cause Italy blocked OpenAI yaaaaay

## Running

First of all, you'll have to set your API key using the `set_key.sh` script (syntax: `./set_key.sh <your_api_key>`)

There is a Makefile at the root of this project, this means that running and installing dependencies is fully automated.

It's as easy as running these commands:


```
$ make install_reqs
$ make run
```
